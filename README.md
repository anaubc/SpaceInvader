### This fun game was created with `Pygames` and the conditional `While` loop
This was a very interesting project for me! It was my first time getting into video games and how their algorithms could work.
I had to download different icons for each character, sounds for different events, and fonts for aesthetics. 
The game allows users to use their keyboards to fire bullets at enemies that are moving at different speeds from different positions!
